# DDoS Attack Detection & Mitigation

## Introduction

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks attempt to exhaust the resources of a network, making services unavailable. In SDNs, centralized control provides better visibility, which can help in detecting such attacks.

## Problem Statement

Traditional methods are not adaptive and suffer from high false positives in high-speed networks.

## Proposed Architecture

1. **Stage 1: Detection**
   - Packet data is preprocessed using wavelet transforms.
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies the packet as attack/normal.

2. **Stage 2: Mitigation**
   - Graph-based trace-back algorithm to identify the source.
   - Edge switch installs drop rules via the SDN controller.

## Algorithms Used

- **Wavelet Transform**: Reduces noise in time-series network traffic.
- **CNN Classifier**: Learns patterns to identify DDoS traffic.
- **Graph Traversal**: Traces malicious packet paths.

## Results

- Detection accuracy: **96.7%**
- Precision: **95.2%**
- F1-score: **95.8%**

## Conclusion

This two-stage model improves detection accuracy and enables fast, real-time mitigation using SDNâ€™s programmability.
