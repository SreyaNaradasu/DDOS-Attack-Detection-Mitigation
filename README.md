# DDoS Attack Detection & Mitigation

This repository presents an overview of a two-stage approach to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks in a Software Defined Network (SDN) environment.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- **Two-stage detection mechanism**:
  - Wavelet transform for preprocessing.
  - CNN classifier for binary classification (attack or not).
- **Mitigation strategy**:
  - Graph-based traffic tracing to identify the source switch.
  - Flow rule installation at edge switches for mitigation.
